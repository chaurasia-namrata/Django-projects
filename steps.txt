create a template folder inside the main project folder with name "templates"
this will have all html files that we want to display or return to the wep page
change in settings.py: TEMPLATES->DIRS -> add in '' the name of folder where we want it to find html files which is in our case 'templates'
create views.py inside wordcount(in same folder as of settings.py and url.py)
in views.py create a func using def that takes the parameter 'request' and return render(request,'xyz.html') here xyz is the name of html page present inside 'templates' folder, which we want to return 
change urls.py and from . import views.py -> create various paths and corresponding function names present in views.py to return/display particular html page
